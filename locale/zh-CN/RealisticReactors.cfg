[mod-setting-description]
manually-check-neighbours=Disables the algorithm, that checks for connected reactors. Disable it on big maps with a lot of heat-pipes, when you experience lags while building your heat-pipe network.\nEnter "connect reactors" into the console (as admin) to start a check manually.
disable-vanilla-reactor=Removes the vanilla reactor from the game.
neighbour-check-delay=When you build your heat-pipe network, the neighbour check algorithm will start after this delay (in ticks).
reactor-scram-duration=The duration of the reactor scram phase in seconds.
reactor-starting-duration=The duration of the reactor starting phase in seconds.
energy_consumption_multiplier=Sets a multiplier for the energy consumption of the starting-phase, cooling and interface\nMin: 0, Default: 1.0, Max: 2.5 (Realistic: 2.5)
calculate-stats-function=This setting controls the power output and fuel efficiency of the reactors.\n\nOwnly's calculation gives you slightly different behaviour for different fuel cell types. The maximum output and efficiency will always be on the highest temperature (+10% per neighbour).\n\nWith Ingo's calculation you have to monitor the temperature more carefully. If you want to have a maximum output with good efficiency, you have to connect your reactors (max 4). On a single reactor the efficiency will drop quickly with high temperatures.\n\nSee the forum post or the included ODT-charts (-> mod folder) for more details on both modes.   
static-cooling-power-consumption=When static is chosen, the reactor will consume 1 MW while the core is being cooled by ECCS.\nOtherwise it will consume 1 MW per 20 MW of cooling.
scram-behaviour=limit to current cell = The reactor will slowly power down until the scam duration is over or the current fuel cell is depleted.\n\nstop half-empty = Reactor will take another fuel cell if current one depletes before scram duration is over. The cell will stay half-consumed in the reactor when it stops.\n\nconsume additional cell = Same as above but the cell will be depleted when the reactor stops.\n\ndecay heat (v1.0.x)= Current fuel is removed and decay heat is produced by script (like in version 1.0.x).
clouds_generation=When the reactor melts, it will emit radioactive clouds from the condensed water. The clouds will move over the map affected by the wind.\nSet a duration for how many seconds this will happen\n(0 - 100 - 9999999)
clouds-duration=Sets the duration (in seconds) how long radioactive clouds will stay\n(1 - 80 - 9999999)
fallout-appearance=Invisible = You will only notice the contaminated area by the geiger-counter sound\n\nHalf-transparent = floating orange particles\n\nLess transparent = Same as above, but better visible\n\nGreen veil = The area will get colored green, but very hard to see in zones with low radiation
fallout-duration=Sets the duration (in seconds) how long fallout contamination will stay\n(1 - 600 - 9999999)
sarcophagus-duration=The time before a sarcophagus or ruin can be removed.
meltdown-mode=Choose what happens if your reactor reaches 1000Â°.\n\nNo meltdown = Nothing will happen, you don't need to worry about overheating your reactors.\n\nMeltdown = Your reactor will explode.\n\nRuin = After the explosion a reactor ruin will remain. It will produce radioactivity and radioactive clouds (depending on fallout mode setting). It can be removed after some time.\n\nRuin + Sarcophagus = You have to build a concrete sarcophagus over the reactor ruin to stop the fallout 'production'. The sarcophagus can be removed after some time.
meltdown-explosion=If you want, you can have a huge nuclear explosion during a reactor meltdown (real reactors don't explode, they melt... but hey, we're not judging you^^). \nThe regular explosion will only destroy the reactor, while the atomic explosion will also destroy an area around it.
fallout-mode=Choose the type of fallout, that occurs on a reactor meltdown.\n\nNo fallout = No radioactive clouds or fallout will occur. \n\nRadioactivity = The local area around the exploded reactor will be contaminated.\n\nClouds and radioactivity = Same as above, also radioactive clouds will appear, moving with the wind and contaminating the area around them.
