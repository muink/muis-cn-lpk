[mod-setting-name]
geothermal-needs-water=Geothermal wells need water input
geothermal-power-factor=Geothermal power production multiplier
geothermal-frequency=Generation Frequency
geothermal-size=Generation Patch Size


[mod-setting-description]
geothermal-needs-water=Should the geothermal wells require water input, or should the water be 'provided' by the well? Requiring input makes logistics much more complicated. Note that changing this means you will have to replace any existing wells.
geothermal-power-factor=Adjust this to control how much power geothermal plants provide.
geothermal-frequency=A multiplier to control how often geothermal patches will generate.
geothermal-size=A multiplier to control how large geothermal regions are. Has no effect with AlienBiomes installed.
