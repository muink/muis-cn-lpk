tree_expansion_frequency=Standard 120 (60-360): lower value results in faster grows, rate of 60 seemed too high after exploring the world a bit.
max_trees=Standard 800k: Large number of trees takes time to save and load, any other aspect of the game gets slower. If you kill enough trees, they will start growing again.
tree_decrease_start=Standard 0.8: Threshold rate to start dropping grow speed: if numTrees < max_trees * tree_decrease_start
pollution_threshold=Standard 1500: If pollution exceeds the threshold, trees will die in the area. There will be no new trees here.
